# metaphorism
“metaphorism, metaphor-er, metaphorest...” ❦ word games and encoded thought experiments.

After a series of life-altering encounters with the delightfully meta “[How Does Work Work](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/presentations/WORK/index.html)” (Mackay & Mackay), which turned out to be too informationally dense to digest at one point in time.

My current best guess at what this approach is trying to achieve is to harness the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) to deliberately attempt to set up some guides to structured thought, which then appear to be particularly recognisable when a confirmatory example is found.
